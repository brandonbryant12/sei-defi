## Strategy Examples

### Automated Yield Optimization
1. Monitor yield rates across Silo, Kriptonite, and native staking
2. Calculate optimal allocation considering gas costs and lock periods
3. Execute automated rebalancing based on yield differentials
4. Compound rewards automatically

### Arbitrage Trading
1. Monitor price differences across DragonSwap pairs
2. Execute triangular arbitrage opportunities
3. MEV protection and optimal execution timing
4. Automated profit extraction and reinvestment

### Risk-Managed Lending
1. Analyze borrowing rates and collateral requirements
2. Execute safe leveraged yield farming strategies
3. Monitor liquidation risks and adjust positions
4. Automated position closure on risk threshold breach

## Performance Targets

- **Target APY**: 15-30% (depending on market conditions)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: <10%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: >2.0
- **Win Rate**: >70% for individual trades
- **Capital Efficiency**: >90% capital utilization

## Security & Risk Management

### Security Features

### Stored Credentials
The following wallet credentials are securely stored in GitHub secrets:
- `SEI_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Main trading wallet address
- `SEI_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: Encrypted private key (64-char hex)
- `SEI_WALLET_MNEMONIC`: BIP39 24-word recovery phrase

### Risk Controls

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brandonbryant12/sei-defi.git
cd sei-defi
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration
Copy the example environment file and configure as needed:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Basic Wallet Operations

#### Create a New SEI Wallet
Generate a new wallet with mnemonic and private key:
```bash
npm run create-wallet
```

This will output:
- SEI address (starts with `sei1...`)
- 24-word mnemonic phrase
- Private key
- Security warnings

#### Check Wallet Balance
Check the balance of any SEI wallet address:
```bash
# Using command line argument
npm run check-balance sei1abc123...

# Or set WALLET_ADDRESS in .env and use:
npm run check-balance
```

This will show:
- Native SEI balance
- All token balances
- Current network info (chain ID, block height)
- Helpful tips for funding and using the wallet

### Environment Variables
